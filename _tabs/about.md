Hi, I'm **Sudeep Tarlekar**, a full-stack web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails and React JS.
Since 2015, I have been working with these technologies to build responsive and user-friendly web applications.
I have worked on a variety of web projects, from small business websites to large-scale web applications.

I am passionate about creating clean, efficient code and building responsive user interfaces that provide a great user experience.
I have extensive experience in both back-end and front-end development, including working with databases, APIs, and responsive design.

As a Ruby on Rails developer, I have a strong understanding of the Rails framework and its conventions.
I have experience building RESTful APIs using Rails, integrating third-party services,
and deploying applications to cloud platforms like Heroku and AWS.

In addition to Rails, I also have expertise in front-end development using React JS.
I enjoy working with React's component-based architecture and the way it facilitates code reusability and maintainability.
I am familiar with Redux, MobX, React Router, and other popular React libraries.

Apart from technical skills, I value collaboration, communication, and continuous learning.
I believe that good communication is essential for successful teamwork, and I strive to keep my teammates
informed and involved throughout the development process.

I also enjoy learning new technologies and techniques, and I am currently pursuing the masters from BITS Pilani in
Data Science and Machine Learning.

In my spare time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, attending meetups and conferences,
reading tech blogs and books, enjoys bicycle rides on weekends. I am excited to be a part of the Ruby on Rails and React JS communities,
and I look forward to collaborating with fellow developers and building awesome web applications.
