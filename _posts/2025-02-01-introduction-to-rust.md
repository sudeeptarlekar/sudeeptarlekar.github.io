According to Stack Overflow survey, Rust is most loved language,
and is redefining the systems programming.
Created by Graydon Hoare in 2006 at Mozilla with a fresh take on
performance and safety, released its first version in 2015.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory safety**: Does not have garbage collector, yet no pointer errors
or buffer overflows. Thanks to borrow checker.
- **Concurrency**: Catches data races at compile time.
- **Cross-Platform**: From embedded system to Web development, Rust does it all.
- **Blazing Fast**: C/C++ like performance with no cost abstraction.
- **Vibrant Ecosystem**: Crates makes the development a breeze.

## Key Features

- Ownership and borrow checking for memory safety.
- Fearless concurrency with thread safety.
- Seamless C interoperability.

Rust is perfect for building fast, reliable, and safe software. Ready to try it? ðŸ¦€
