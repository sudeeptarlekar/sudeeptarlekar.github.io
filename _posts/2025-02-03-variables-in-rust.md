As we have already installed Rust on local, lets explore
basics of Rust syntax, focusing on variables, constants and
shadowing.

## Variables

In Rust, variables are immutable by default, which means once
value is assigned to the variable then it cannot be changed.
To make variable mutable, `mut` keyword must be used.

**Example:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;          // Immutable variable
    let mut y = x * 2;  // Mutable variable

    println!("x: {}; y: {}", x, y);

    y = 20;

    println!("Updated Values => x: {x}; y: {y}");
}

```

**Key Points:**

- Use `let` to declare variables.
- Variables are immutable by default; Use `mut` for mutability.

## Constants

Constants are always immutable and must be explicitly typed.
They are declared using the `const` keyword and are valid for the entire program lifetime.

**Example:**

```rust
fn main() {
    const PI: f32 = 3.14159;  // Constant with explicit type
    println!("The value of PI is: {}", PI);
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Use `const` for declaring constants and constants must declare type annotations.
- Cannot use `mut` with constants.

## Shadowing

Shadowing allows you to reuse a variable name by creating a new variable with the same name.
This is different from mutability because the original variable is effectively "shadowed" by the new one.

**Example:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = x + 1; // Shadowing creates new variable `x`

    {
        let x = x * 2; // Shadowing within a scope
        println!("Inner x: {}", x); // Output: 12
    }
    println!("Outer x: {}", x); // Output: 6
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Shadowing creates a new variable under the same name.
- Useful for transforming data without mutating the original variable.
- Works across different scopes.

### Summary

- **Variables**: Immutable by default; use `mut` for mutability.
- **Constants**: Always immutable, require explicit typing, and use `const` to declare.
- **Shadowing**: Reuse variable names to create new variables, even in nested scopes.

These concepts form the foundation of Rustâ€™s syntax and help ensure safe and predictable code.
Start experimenting with these basics, and youâ€™ll quickly get comfortable with Rustâ€™s unique approach! ðŸ¦€
